# Description 
This project focuses on developing an Email/SMS spam classifier using the Naive Bayes theorem. The Naive Bayes algorithm is a simple and effective method for building classifiers, and it works well for text classification tasks such as spam detection. The goal of this project is to classify a given message as either spam or ham using the Naive Bayes classifier. The classifier is trained using a dataset of labeled messages, where each message is tagged as either spam or ham. The Naive Bayes classifier is then used to predict the classification of new messages based on their features. The performance of the classifier is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results show that the Naive Bayes classifier is an effective method for email/SMS spam classification, with high accuracy and low false positive rates.

# Dataset Used
In this proposed system, a dataset from “Kaggle” website is used as a training dataset. (SMS Spam Collection Dataset)

The SMS Spam Collection is a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam research. It contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,574  messages, tagged according being ham (legitimate) or spam.
The files contain one message per line. Each line is composed by two columns: v1 contains the label (ham or spam) and v2 contains the raw text.
The data has been collected from free or free for research sources from the Internet and is the most commonly used dataset for SMS spam detection.

# Summary
In conclusion, Naive Bayes Algorithm has proven to be an effective method for classifying emails as spam or not spam. The algorithm works by calculating the probability of an email belonging to a particular class based on the occurrence of certain words or features. This approach is relatively simple, but it is surprisingly accurate in practice. Overall, this project highlights the potential of machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes for detecting spam emails. By using these techniques, we can improve email security and reduce the amount of unwanted emails that users receive.
